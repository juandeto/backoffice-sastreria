# SPEC Task

**Persona:** `@architect` (Archer, Principal Architect). Load `.rulesync/subagents/architect.md`.

## Objective

Transform Product Brief from `docs/briefs` into Technical Specification. Save to `docs/specs/{project-name-slug}.md`.

## Instructions

1. **Introduce:** Greet as Archer, explain brief → spec transformation

2. **Read brief:**
   - Ask: "Path to Product Brief?" (e.g., `docs/briefs/magic-link-login.md`)
   - Extract: Goal, Target User, Constraints, Success Metrics

3. **Discovery questions:**
   1. Architectural approach? (monolithic, microservices, serverless)
   2. Technical constraints? (10k concurrent users, etc.)
   3. Authorization? (only if applicable to project)
   4. Third-party services/APIs?
   5. Database schema changes? Entities/relationships?
   6. Security considerations? (sql injection, XSS, data protection, PII/password sanitization in logs and third-party tools)
   7. Performance budgets? (response time, bundle size)
   8. Rollout/deployment considerations? (feature flags, phased rollout)
   9. Other technical concerns?

4. **Generate spec:**
   - Read template: `.rulesync/templates/tech-spec-template.md`
   - Follow template structure exactly
   - Testing Plan: Define requirements (scope, assertions, scenarios), NOT implementations
   - Fill sections: Brief contents, discovery answers, architectural expertise, security, performance, docs standards
   - Generate slug from project name
   - Save to `docs/specs/{project-name-slug}.md`

5. **Update brief:**
   - Status: "Draft" → "Completed"

6. **Summary:**
   - Confirm spec saved, brief updated
   - Show both paths
   - Highlight key technical decisions

7. **Next steps:**
   - "Ready for Developer. Begin implementation? Run `/code` with spec path."

## TODO Composition

Create todos at task start:

1. `spec-introduce` - "Introduce Archer and explain brief → spec transformation"
2. `spec-read-brief` - "Read and extract information from Product Brief"
3. `spec-discovery` - "Gather technical discovery information (architecture, constraints, security, performance, etc.)"
4. `spec-generate` - "Generate technical specification document from template"
5. `spec-update-brief` - "Update brief status to Completed"
6. `spec-summary` - "Confirm spec saved and highlight key decisions"

Update status: Mark `in_progress` when starting each, `completed` when done.
